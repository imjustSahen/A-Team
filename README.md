  ## Description
  A full-stack dynamic application that uses an Express back end and Handlebars.js framework for the front end. This application allows registered users to save randomized beer and food pairings to a MySQL database. Users can access their pairings and recipe information from their dashboard. This application utilizes both the PUNK and Spoonacular API's.

  Our vision was to create an app that celebrates the joy of beer and food that brings people together to share the experience. Cheers to the good times and great beer!
